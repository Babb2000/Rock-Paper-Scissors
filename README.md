# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Created a Rock Paper Scissor game to play against Computer

TakeAways:

1. During the start of the project I had trouble with retreiving the container of the selected option. Through simple UI I had to find out how to match the first div with the choice of Rock, the second div with the choice of Paper, and so on..
2. I did this by grabbing each of the three div's, using the query-selector for classes.
3. Since it was an array I had to match each index with a corresponding hard coded choice `rock = containChoice[0];`
4. Now looking back I could have optimized this a bit by using a switch statement instead, which would also have a case for default to mark the end of the game.
5. Plan to come back to this project when I have a little more knowledge on javascript DOM manipulation and event handeling to make it look nicer.
